# A Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
 
# Create tuple (use paratheses)
fruits = ('Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes')
# fruits2 = tuple(('Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes'))

# Single value needs trailing comma
fruits2 = ('Apples',)

# Get value
print(fruits[1])

# Can't change value
# fruits[0] = 'Pears'

# Delete tuple
del fruits2

# Get length
print(len(fruits))

# print(fruits, type(fruits2))

# A Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
